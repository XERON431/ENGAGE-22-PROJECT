# ENGAGE-22-PROJECT
Name - Siddhant Goyal
This is a project which I have made under The mentorship program "MICROSOFT ENGAGE 22".
This project is based on the second challenge, i.e, Data Analytics.
I started to work on this project by first visualising the given data in csv file provided to us.
After visualisation, I found that a lot of Data has been missing from the excel sheet.
So, my first task waas to impute the given data.
I started by removing the unnamed columns.
Then, I then I calculated null value percentage for remaining columns and dropped the columns who were more than 70 percent null because such data was anyways redundant.
Then I imputed the remaining columns like for example in the make column I filled all the empty columns similarly I imputed other entries like highway mileage,city mileage, etc.
then comes the preparation part.
Columns like ex- showroom price which had alphanumeric entries could not be used for analysis. Hence, we need to convert the data into numeric type.
This is done by dropping Rs. symbol and commas from entries.
Then I coverted the data type from object to float.
Then I decided to use different to pictorial techniques like bar graphs, charts, etc. to visualise the data.
Finally 
I used Regression Algorithms to compare the growth of price with the increase in cylinders in the car.
I used linear and polynomial regression Algorithms.
We found out that Linear Regression had an accuracy of 62.4% and Polynomial Regression had an accuracy of 64%.
Similarly, I have made many comparisions in the project to analyse the data.
